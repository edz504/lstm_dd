Note that in most code, files use paths relative to the main Caffe_lstm directory as
the standard Caffe code does.

Added:
src/caffe/layers/non_para_relu_layer.cpp
src/caffe/layers/non_para_relu_layer.cu
    - following prelu_layer.cpp and .cu, which have a learnable parameter too
tools/split_train_valid_test.py
    - take original 14-dim train set, and split into X-long train set,
      Y-long validation set, Z-long test set, adding 15th marker dimensions as well
    - note this writes to ~/Thesis/data, but I manually copied it to nonparametric/data
nonparametric/
    - folder to hold nonparametric models
nonparametric/lstm_np_01
    - folder holding non-parametric model 1: replacing ReLU with non-parametric ReLU
    - driving_train_lstm.prototxt follows torcs/lstm_11
nonparametric/data
    - folder holding data including datasets produced from split_train_valid_test.py (LevelDBs),
      mean_files, etc.
nonparametric/make_image_means.sh
    - modified version of examples/imagenet/make_imagenet_means.sh

Modified:
include/caffe/neuron_layers.hpp
    - added class definition for NonParaReLULayer
src/caffe/layers/proto/caffe.proto
    - added layer and parameter definitions for NonParaReLULayer and NonParaReLUParameter


CMake / compile notes:
    must follow CMake instructions under Caffe installation for SMILE machine
    modify cmake/Modules/FindAtlas.cmake as per
    <https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/2394/files>
